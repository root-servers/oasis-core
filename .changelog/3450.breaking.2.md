Remove `SignedRuntime`

As part of the work on [ADR 0004], support for signed runtime descriptors
has been removed, since they are no longer required.
All methods that used to take signed runtime descriptors now take
non-signed runtime descriptors instead.
This also affects the genesis file, use the `oasis-node debug fix-genesis`
command to convert a genesis file from the old format to the new one.
